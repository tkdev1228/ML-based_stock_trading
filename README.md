# ML-based_stock_trading
- I have created a Python script that performs a series of financial data processing tasks: acquiring stock price data, processing the data, training an ARIMA model, calculating moving 
  averages, and generating moving average crossover signals.

# Objective & Process
- Obtain stock price data and perform basic data processing.
- Train an automatic ARIMA model to generate forecasts for the stock price data.
- Evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model using time series cross-validation.
- Train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices using ARIMA model predictions.
- Calculate moving averages (10-day, 50-day, 200-day) and generate moving average crossover signals.
- Generate trading signals based on long-short strategies.
